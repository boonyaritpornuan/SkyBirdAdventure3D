"Propy Bird"
1. Core Concept Shift
Theme: Replace the jungle snake theme with a sky-based adventure where a bird navigates through obstacles.

Objective: Fly through gaps in pipes instead of collecting fruit.

2. Key UI Changes
Background:

Gradient sky (blue to light green) with animated clouds.

Floating particles (e.g., sparkles or dust) for depth.

Title Screen:

"PROPY BIRD" in 3D gold/yellow text with a fiery glow.

Animated flapping bird (LottieFiles) below the title.

Interactive Elements:

Play Button: Glowing wing-flap animation (LottieFiles).

Icons: Replace snake-themed icons with bird/cloud motifs.

3. Gameplay Mechanics Overhaul
Movement System:

Gravity Physics: Bird falls naturally; tap/spacebar to "flap" upward.

Fluid Motion: Smooth vertical movement with velocity adjustments.

Obstacles:

Random Pipes: Generate vertical pipes with random gaps.

Collision Detection: Bird dies if it hits pipes or screen edges.

Progression:

Speed Increase: Game speeds up as score rises.

Score System: +1 point per pipe cleared.

4. Visual & Audio Enhancements
Animations:

Bird flap/wing motion (LottieFiles).

Pipe-spawning effects (e.g., growing from the ground).

Screen shake on collision.

Sound Design:

Flap Sound: Feathery "whoosh" on jump.

Crash Sound: Shattering glass effect.

Background Music: Upbeat chiptune track.

5. Cross-Platform Optimization
Mobile Controls:

Full-screen tap-to-flap functionality.

Auto-hide UI elements during gameplay.

Responsive Scaling:

Bird and pipe sizes adjust to screen dimensions.

Dynamic camera framing for vertical movement.

6. Additional Features
Instruction Screen:

Animated arrows (tap/spacebar demo).

Bird flying through a pipe example.

Game Over Screen:

Score display with retro font.

"Restart" button with flame animation.

Extras (Optional):

Collectible golden feathers for bonus points.

Day/night cycle with background changes.

Development Workflow
Asset Creation: Design bird sprites, pipe graphics, and animations.

Physics Setup: Implement gravity, jump force, and collision logic.

Obstacle System: Code infinite pipe generation with random gaps.

UI Integration: Add score display, menus, and touch controls.

Polishing: Add particle effects, sound triggers, and difficulty tuning.

Critical Considerations
Ensure low input lag for precise controls.

Balance pipe gaps and speed for challenging but fair gameplay.

Optimize animations for smooth performance on all devices.
